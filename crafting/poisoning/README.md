do -info on whatever food item you want to poison and put the DisplayedGraphic variable in the place of [food]
oh... on the second "while" loop
you'll have to adjust the number after the < to whatever max the current poison you're pulling from the shelf to gain is
it goes really quick though
also, make sure to pull at least 5 cures on your loadout from your shelf
you poison yourself on failed attempts sometimes
